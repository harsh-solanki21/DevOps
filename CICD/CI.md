# Continuous Integration (CI)

## What is Continuous Integration?

- Continuous Integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

- It most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both:

  - An automation component (e.g., a CI or build service)
  - A cultural component (e.g., learning to integrate frequently)

- Key goals of continuous integration:
  - Find and address bugs quicker
  - Improve software quality
  - Reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates

## How does Continuous Integration Work?

1. Developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system (e.g., Git).
2. Prior to each commit, developers may run local unit tests on their code as an extra verification layer.
3. A continuous integration service automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes.
4. This process immediately surfaces any errors.

## Continuous Integration Benefits

1. **Improve Developer Productivity**

   - Frees developers from manual tasks
   - Encourages behaviors that help reduce errors and bugs released to customers

2. **Find and Address Bugs Quicker**

   - More frequent testing allows the team to discover and address bugs earlier
   - Prevents small issues from growing into larger problems

3. **Deliver Updates Faster**
   - Helps the team deliver updates to customers faster and more frequently
